# Push_Swap

"42 Push Swap" is a sorting algorithm project in C language that aims to sort a given set of integers using only two stacks and a set of predefined operations. The program must output a list of these operations that, when executed, would correctly sort the given set of integers in ascending order. The objective of the project is to minimize the number of operations needed to sort the integers. The project is part of the curriculum at 42, a coding school that promotes peer-to-peer learning and self-improvement.
